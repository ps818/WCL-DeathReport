# WarcraftLogs Death Report

This tool provides a death report for an entire tier as a single pane of glass for guildmasters and recruiters
to see how often a player contributes to the first x deaths of a pull.

Use this as another tool in your arsenal of evaluating players to see how good of a player they are.
